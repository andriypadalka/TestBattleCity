# TestBattleCity
 This project is intended just to show its architecture and my coding style.
It was originally my test work, that I received as an applicant for a job position from one of 
software company (and successfully done). It is an attempt to implement some functionality from 
BattleCity game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPsA5PtfdL0&t=132s (at least its firt level).
But while studying this game from youtube I decided to add ability to choose level, set velocity
of tanks and shells, streets width, how fast enemy tanks will appeare and max count of them.
 A description of this program's architecture is in Tasks.h file.
(Untill now not all functionalities was fulfilled, but I hope I'll find some late evenings to implement them. :-)
